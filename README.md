# Marvel-Data-LUA
- A script designed to gather data for Mugen, as well as make editing/gathering sprite/animation info easier and accurate
- IMPORTANT!!!
- "File" refers to the numbered file found in a given games ROM. Can be opened in HxD to get raw data
- SUPPORTED GAMES
- xmcota
- xmvsf
- mvsc
- msh
- mshvsf
-     REVISION 1.1
- Added display for FrameTime to make finding data in the ROM a bit easier
- Per the request of Sir Ghostler, added support for MSHVSF
- Added the option to press O to decrement the current player
-     REVISION 1.2
- Can now use the script whenever ya like
- Can target any player, any time
- Added TileDef output
- XCOTAs Character Select timer was wrong, now properly freezes
- A port over from the Samsho script, can display Pos/Vel Data as either converted Floats for Mugen, or Hexadecimal like the Source game
-     REVISION 1.3
- XMCOTA Handles sprites slightly differently than the other VS Games, requiring 2 Pointers for the TileMap as opposed to 1. The script now accommodates that
- Alongside that change, the script now properly updates depending on the current game, and it now shows which game is currently loaded for fun
-     REVISION 1.4
- Added a new mode, Address. This displays the raw Unit ID addresses for stuff like Velocity and Anim, hopefully streamlining the usage of Watchpoints and the like via MAME
- The Lua now displays the AnimElem data in real-time. Can swap the Endian by pressing Z, by default it displays the data the game sees, whereas swapping the Endian views the raw data from the program data you would see in any given Hex Editor
